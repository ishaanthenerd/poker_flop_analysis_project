# Welcome to my poker flop analysis project!

This is an independent project done by me, Ishaan Gupta. Currently, it is a work-in progress, so here are some features I will be adding soon:
* Completion of Next.js tutorial
* Analysis of a flop by its strength and texture
* Analysis of a single player's hole cards with respect to a flop
* Analysis of all possible turn and river cards after the flop
